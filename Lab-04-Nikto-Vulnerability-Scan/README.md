# ✅ Lab 04: Vulnerability Scanning with Nikto

## 🎯 Objective

Scan a web server for known vulnerabilities, outdated software, and insecure configurations using Nikto.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Nikto
- Perl

## 🔄 Task Summary

- Install and run Nikto.
- Scan a test target (e.g., `testphp.vulnweb.com`).
- Understand basic web vulnerability scanning results.

## 🧪 Steps

### 🔹 Step 1: Install dependencies

`bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y perl git build-essential libssl-dev
`

### 🔹 Step 2: Clone Nikto and navigate to the program

`bash
git clone https://github.com/sullo/nikto.git
cd nikto/program
`

### 🔹 Step 3: Perform a basic scan

`bash
perl nikto.pl -h http://testphp.vulnweb.com
`

### 🔹 Step 4: Perform an advanced scan (with tuning)

`bash
perl nikto.pl -h http://testphp.vulnweb.com -Tuning 123b
`

## 👀 Observations

- Nikto scans for server misconfigurations, insecure headers, outdated software, etc.
- Tuning options allow focused scanning (e.g., XSS, interesting files).
- Output includes server banners and vulnerability hints.

## ✅ Expected Output

- A detailed list of potential web server vulnerabilities, such as:
- Outdated Apache version
- Missing security headers
- Directory listings enabled
- Results useful for follow-up testing with other tools like Burp or Metasploit.
