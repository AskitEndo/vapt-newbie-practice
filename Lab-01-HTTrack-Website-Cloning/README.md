# âœ… Lab 01: Website Cloning & Offline Browsing with HTTrack

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Learn how to clone and mirror websites for offline analysis using HTTrack. Understand the limitations of static website cloning and explore the structure of downloaded sites.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- HTTrack

## ðŸ”„ Task Summary
- Clone a public website using HTTrack.
- Analyze the local copy for assets, structure, and resources.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Install HTTrack
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install httrack
```

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Clone a website
```bash
httrack "http://example.com" -O ~/offline-site
```

### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Navigate and open the offline website

- HTTrack downloads HTML, images, JavaScript, CSS, and other static resources.
- It does not clone backend code, databases, or server-side logic.
- Ideal for passive reconnaissance and offline analysis.

## âœ… Expected Output
- A complete offline version of the target website that can be viewed in a browser.
- Folder structure mirroring the original website with all static files.
